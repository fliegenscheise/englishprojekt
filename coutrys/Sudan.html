            <p>China and Sudan maintain close diplomatic, economic, and political relations, with China being one of
                Sudan’s largest trade partners. China invests heavily in Sudan’s oil sector, while Sudan acts as a
                reliable political ally on the international stage. Formal diplomatic relations were established in
                1959, and the partnership has strengthened over time.</p>
            <p>Economic ties began in the 1960s when China and Sudan signed agreements to exchange Sudanese cotton for
                Chinese manufactured goods. In the 1990s, China intensified its involvement in Sudan’s oil industry,
                especially after the U.S. imposed sanctions on Sudan in 1997. China supported Sudan through
                infrastructure development and financial aid.</p>
            <p>Although China officially follows a policy of non-interference, it influenced political developments in
                Sudan, particularly during the Second Sudanese Civil War (1985–2005), by providing financial and
                infrastructural support to the Sudanese government. During the Darfur crisis, China faced international
                criticism for supplying arms to Sudan but later engaged in peace negotiations and supported UN
                resolutions under international pressure.</p>
            <p>Sudan has also supported China on geopolitical issues, such as the Xinjiang conflict, by defending
                China's policies against the Uyghurs. After the overthrow of President Omar al-Bashir in 2019, China
                backed the new leadership to maintain stability for its investments in the country.</p>
            <p>China remains Sudan’s largest trading partner, particularly in the energy sector. Despite South Sudan’s
                secession in 2011, which resulted in Sudan losing most of its oil reserves, economic relations between
                China and Sudan remain strong. Chinese investments in infrastructure projects, power plants, and
                railways have significantly impacted Sudan’s economy, reducing its dependence on imports and
                strengthening bilateral cooperation.</p>

            <h2>Colonial History</h2>
            <p>In the 19th century, the region of present-day Sudan was dominated by two major powers: the Kingdom of
                Sannar in the east and the Sultanate of Darfur in the west. In 1820, Egypt's Ottoman ruler, Muhammad Ali
                Pasha, launched a military expedition to bring Sudan under Egyptian influence, securing access to gold
                and slaves. Following the conquest, massive slave recruitment began, further expanding the slave trade.
                In the 1870s, Egypt sent European officials, including Charles George Gordon, to organize administration
                and curb slavery.</p>
            <p>In 1881, the religious leader Muhammad Ahmad (al-Mahdi) led a rebellion against Egyptian-British rule.
                After his victory, he established an Islamic government in Omdurman, which was later continued by his
                successor, Abdallahi ibn Muhammad. However, in 1898, the Mahdist forces were defeated by
                British-Egyptian troops under General Herbert Kitchener.</p>
            <p>Following the British conquest, Sudan was administered as an Anglo-Egyptian condominium but remained
                effectively a British colony. Economically, cotton cultivation was intensified, and the capital,
                Khartoum, was further developed. Christian missionaries expanded their influence in the south. In 1948,
                Britain initiated an administrative reform, and elections were held in 1953. In 1955, the first civil
                war began between the Islamic Arab north and the Christian Black south.</p>
