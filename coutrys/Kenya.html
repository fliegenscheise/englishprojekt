            <h2>Neocolonialism</h2>
            <p>China has financed and built several major infrastructure projects in Kenya, including the elevated
                expressway in Nairobi, connecting the airport to the business district, the deep-sea port in Lamu,
                intended to ease congestion in Mombasa, and the railway from Mombasa to Nairobi, which cost around $5
                billion.</p>
            <p>However, these projects face criticism: The Lamu port is considered oversized, the railway is seen as
                unprofitable, and corruption allegedly siphoned off $2 billion. Kenya’s high debt to China raises
                concerns about Beijing’s potential political influence, according to economist James Shikwati.</p>
            <p>While some Kenyans see China’s investments as progress, others fear financial dependency. China itself
                has become more cautious with new investments, leading Kenya to turn back to Western partners like the
                U.S., Europe, Japan, and South Korea, using their loans to repay its debts to China.</p>

            <h2>Colonial History</h2>
            <p>Kenya's colonial history began in 1885 with a German protectorate over coastal territories. However,
                Germany handed these regions to Britain in 1890, and the Imperial British East Africa Company (IBEA)
                took over administration.
            </p>
            <p>In 1895, the British Crown assumed direct control. The completion of the Uganda Railway in 1901 and a
                severe famine in 1899 allowed Britain to expand its rule. African resistance was violently suppressed
                through "punitive expeditions," in which villages were burned, cattle stolen, and land confiscated.
                Fertile regions were designated as “White Highlands” for European settlers, while many African
                communities, such as the Kikuyu, Maasai, and Nandi, were forcibly relocated to reserves.</p>
            <p>During World War I, 150,000 Kenyans were conscripted as porters under brutal conditions, often resembling
                slave raids. After the war, contact with other African soldiers helped spread political awareness and
                pan-African ideas.</p>
            <p>n 1920, Kenya became an official British Crown Colony, and white settlers gained more influence. Through
                land seizures, high taxes, and mandatory registration, Africans were forced into labor markets. The
                British administration sought to establish a settler-dominated colony, similar to South Africa.</p>
