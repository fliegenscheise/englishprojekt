            <h2>Neocolonialism</h2>
            <p> Kilamba, a city built by China in Angola, was initially designed as a modern housing project. However,
                the high prices made it unaffordable, leaving the city empty for years. Only after the government
                reduced prices and allowed payment plans over 30 years did people start moving in. </p>
            <p> Today, Kilamba is home to over 100,000 residents. It features wide streets, parks, and modern apartment
                buildings, representing an urban revolution. However, serious structural issues—cracks in buildings,
                water damage, and poor construction quality—make the city look much older than it is. Despite these
                flaws, many residents feel safer and more comfortable compared to the slums of Luanda. </p>
            <p> Angolan architects like Lidiu Daio believe the future lies in smaller, more sustainable houses with
                urban gardens to ensure food security. With China no longer dominating infrastructure projects, local
                companies are exploring innovations like 3D-printed homes. </p>
            <p> While Kilamba offers many benefits, its poor construction quality raises concerns about whether it will
                still be livable in ten years. </p>

            <h2>Colonial History</h2>
            <h3> Treatment of the Indigenous Population Under Portuguese Rule in Angola </h2>

            <p> Portuguese colonial rule in Angola was marked by economic exploitation, social discrimination, and
                brutal repression of the indigenous population. Enslavement, forced labor, and systemic oppression
                defined the lives of Angolans for centuries. </p>

            <h3> 1. Enslavement and Forced Labor </h3>

            <p> From the moment the Portuguese arrived in 1483, the local population was used as labor—mostly under
                extreme coercion. During the peak of the transatlantic slave trade (16th–19th centuries), millions of
                Angolans were captured and sold to Brazil, the Caribbean, and Portugal. African intermediaries,
                including local rulers and traders, often played a role in this trade. </p>

            <p> Even after the transatlantic slave trade was officially abolished in 1836, forced labor continued under
                different systems. One of the most notorious was <strong>"Chibalo"</strong>, a system that forced
                African men to work unpaid for Portuguese businesses, plantations, and infrastructure projects. Those
                who refused faced harsh punishments or imprisonment. </p>

            <h3> 2. Social Discrimination and Oppression </h3>

            <p> The Portuguese established a rigid social hierarchy in which white settlers and European immigrants held
                the highest positions, while the indigenous population was systematically marginalized. </p>
            <p> Africans had little access to education, political rights, or economic opportunities. Some individuals
                could attain Portuguese citizenship through the <strong>"Assimilado"</strong> system, but only if they
                adopted European customs, spoke Portuguese, and converted to Catholicism. However, the criteria were so
                strict that only a small number of Africans were granted this status, while the majority remained
                second-class citizens. </p>

            <h3> 3. Brutal Repression and Resistance </h3>

            <p> Any resistance to Portuguese rule was met with extreme violence. During the independence struggle of the
                1960s and 1970s, the Portuguese military launched brutal counterinsurgency campaigns, destroying
                villages and using torture to suppress nationalist movements. </p>

            <p> Despite this repression, Angolan resistance movements like <strong>MPLA, FNLA, and UNITA</strong> fought
                for independence. The overthrow of Portugal’s dictatorship in the <strong>1974 Carnation
                    Revolution</strong> led to the collapse of Portuguese colonial rule, and Angola finally gained
                independence on <strong>November 11, 1975</strong>. </p>

            <h3> Conclusion </h2>

            <p> Portuguese rule in Angola was characterized by severe exploitation and oppression of the indigenous
                population. Enslavement, forced labor, and social discrimination defined colonial Angola, and resistance
                was met with brutal repression. However, through decades of struggle, Angolans eventually won their
                independence. </p>
