            <h3> Summary of Chinese Investment and Trade in Ghana </h3>

            <p> Since the 2000s, Chinese trade and investment in Ghana have significantly increased. While investments
                were only $4.4 million in 2000, they rose to $1.6 billion in 2014. Initially, the manufacturing and
                trade sectors were the main recipients of Chinese investments, but by 2015, the construction and
                infrastructure sectors had become the largest beneficiaries. </p>

            <p> China views Ghana as a strategic economic hub in West Africa, evident in the opening of the China-Africa
                Development Fund office in Accra in 2011. </p>

            <h3> Economic Assistance </h3>

            <p> Since the 1980s, China has provided financial aid to Ghana, including interest-free loans for major
                projects like the Ghana National Theater. Other key projects include: </p>

            <ul>
                <li> A $66 million loan to upgrade Ghana’s telecommunications network. </li>
                <li> A $6 billion loan for railway expansion. </li>
                <li> $562 million for the construction of the Bui hydroelectric dam. </li>
                <li> Interest-free loans for road and infrastructure projects. </li>
                <li> Technical training for over 700 Ghanaians in various sectors. </li>
            </ul>
            <h3> Trade and Foreign Direct Investment </h3>

            <p> China is Ghana’s second-largest exporter. In 2005, Ghana imported $433.74 million worth of goods from
                China while exporting only $0.1 million. Chinese investments are mainly in manufacturing, construction,
                tourism, trading, and services. Total Chinese FDI increased from $199 million (2000–2007) to $2.2
                billion (2008–2015). </p>

            <p> Beyond state investments, an increasing number of Chinese entrepreneurs have migrated to Ghana. These
                traders offer low-cost goods but have displaced local Ghanaian merchants and products from neighboring
                African countries. This has led to tensions between Ghanaian traders and Chinese migrants, particularly
                over market spaces. </p>

            <p> In 2008, President John Evans Atta-Mills promised to refurbish the Kotokoraba Market in Cape Coast and
                sought Chinese funding for the project. </p>

            <h2>Colonial History</h2>
            <h3> The Path to Colonial Rule (1821–1900) </h3>

            <p> In the 19th century, only Britain, the Netherlands, and Denmark maintained fortified trading posts along
                the Gold Coast. In 1821, the British Colonial Office took control of British forts but delegated their
                management to a council of British merchants from 1828. George Maclean, president of the council,
                expanded British influence, enforcing British law in a 40 km coastal zone. Growing conflicts with the
                Ashanti Kingdom led to an increased British military presence. </p>

            <p> In 1844, the Fanti, allied with the British, acknowledged British legal authority in their territory.
                Over the following decades, Britain acquired Danish and Dutch forts, becoming the sole European power on
                the Gold Coast by 1872. A Fanti attempt to establish an independent state between 1868 and 1873 failed.
            </p>

            <p> In 1874, Britain defeated the Ashanti and declared Southern Ghana a Crown Colony. By 1896, they forced
                the Ashanti to recognize British rule and exiled their king to the Seychelles. A final Ashanti uprising
                in 1900 was crushed, and Britain took control of Northern Ghana the same year. </p>

            <h3> British Rule Over the Gold Coast (1900–1945) </h3>

            <p> After World War I, British Togoland was incorporated into the British Gold Coast. The British
                administration divided their colony into three distinct regions: </p>

            <ul>
                <li> <b>Crown Colony:</b> Limited political freedoms, press freedom, and a class of Western-educated
                    Africans cooperating with the colonial government. </li>
                <li> <b>Ashanti Protectorate:</b> British efforts to suppress Ashanti traditions, ban lawyers, and
                    restrict political activities. </li>
                <li> <b>Northern Territories:</b> Excluded from political reforms and denied representation in the
                    legislative council. </li>
            </ul>

            <p> In the 1920s, Governor Guggisberg implemented the "Indirect Rule" system, using local chiefs for
                colonial administration. </p>
