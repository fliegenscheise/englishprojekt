            <h2> Neocolonialism</h2>
            <p>China plays a significant role in Ethiopia, having provided the country with approximately €12 billion in
                loans. These funds are mainly used to develop infrastructure, including tram systems, railway lines, and
                industrial parks. Ethiopia views this as an opportunity for economic growth and job creation.</p>
            <p>The Chinese loans are part of the Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to expand trade routes and create
                economic dependencies. Critics warn of a potential "debt trap," as Ethiopia's national debt has already
                reached 59% of its GDP. In response, China extended repayment periods for certain loans.</p>
            <p>Ethiopia closely follows China’s economic model, establishing special economic zones to drive
                industrialization. The government hopes to replicate China’s success in creating a middle class through
                industrial development. However, Ethiopia remains largely an agricultural economy.</p>
            <p>China benefits from this partnership by securing economic and geopolitical influence. In Africa, however,
                Chinese involvement is controversial. The U.S. and the EU are trying to counterbalance China's presence
                with their own investments. Despite accusations of exploitation, Chinese firms have created jobs, and
                many Ethiopians view the investments positively. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed is navigating between China’s
                economic influence and Western interests.</p>

            <h2>Colonial History</h2>
            <p>Ethiopia's history in the 19th and 20th centuries was marked by colonialism, modernization, and political
                upheaval. Emperor Tewodros II resisted European colonialism but clashed with Britain, leading to the
                British Ethiopian expedition in 1868. His successor, Yohannes IV, stabilized the empire and fought the
                Mahdists but was killed in battle in 1889.
            </p>
            <p>Menelik II (1889–1913) expanded Ethiopia’s territory and successfully defended the country against
                Italian colonization. In 1896, Ethiopia defeated Italy in the Battle of Adwa, preserving its
                independence. Italy only managed to conquer Ethiopia under Mussolini in 1936, but British forces
                liberated the country in 1941.</p>
            <p>Haile Selassie attempted modernization but remained authoritarian. In 1974, he was overthrown by a
                socialist military dictatorship (Derg) led by Mengistu Haile Mariam. The Derg regime brought repression,
                famine, and civil wars. In 1991, the regime collapsed, Eritrea gained independence, and Ethiopia began
                democratization under the EPRDF.</p>
            <p>Since then, Ethiopia has experienced economic growth but continues to face social and political
                challenges.</p>
