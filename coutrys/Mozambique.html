            <h2>Neocolonialism</h2>
            <p>China and Mozambique have maintained relations since the 1960s, when China supported the Marxist FRELIMO
                party in its fight against Portuguese colonial rule. Official diplomatic ties were established in 1975
                after Mozambique gained independence. Since then, China has made significant investments in the country,
                particularly in trade, infrastructure, and development aid.</p>
            <p>China is one of Mozambique’s largest trading partners, importing mainly agricultural and fishery products
                while exporting machinery and consumer goods. Despite regulations against the export of raw timber,
                China is a major buyer of Mozambican wood, often through illegal channels.</p>
            <p>Chinese companies dominate Mozambique’s construction sector, especially in road-building. Critics argue
                that they do not transfer skills or technology to locals and prefer using Chinese labor. China has also
                provided development aid in the form of low-interest loans and debt relief while constructing public
                buildings such as the national parliament and a stadium.</p>
            <p>China has also been active in humanitarian efforts: in 2017, the Chinese hospital ship Peace Ark treated
                nearly 10,000 patients in Mozambique. Politically, Mozambique supports China, including endorsing the
                controversial Hong Kong security law at the United Nations.</p>

            <h2>Colonial History</h2>
            <p>During Portuguese colonial rule in Mozambique, the indigenous population suffered centuries of
                oppression, exploitation, and violence. The colonial system was based on economic exploitation and
                racial hierarchy, systematically disadvantaging the local people.</p>
            <p>Early Colonial Period (16th–18th Century): Violence, Slavery, and Forced Labor
                After the Portuguese arrived in the late 15th century, they used brutal force to subjugate the local
                population. They sought control over Mozambique’s coastal trade cities, often clashing with Swahili and
                Arab merchants.</p>
            <p>One of the most brutal aspects of Portuguese rule was the enslavement of the local people. Mozambique
                became a major hub of the transatlantic slave trade, with hundreds of thousands of people forcibly taken
                to Brazil, the Caribbean, and other Portuguese colonies. Many were forced to work on plantations and in
                mines under inhumane conditions. The Prazo system (introduced in the 17th century) further entrenched
                oppression: Portuguese settlers and local elites were granted vast estates, where African laborers were
                treated as serfs or outright slaves.</p>
            <p>19th Century: Continued Exploitation and Racial Segregation
                Although Portugal officially abolished slavery in 1878, little changed for the indigenous population.
                Instead of freedom, the colonial administration introduced a system of forced labor (chibalo), where men
                were required to work for Portuguese settlers or European companies for months without pay.
            </p>
            <p>A racial hierarchy further disadvantaged the indigenous population. Africans were denied access to
                education, healthcare, and political rights. Only a small elite, the "Assimilados"—Africans who adopted
                Portuguese culture and language—were granted limited citizenship rights.</p>
            <p>From 1890 onward, Portugal handed over large parts of Mozambique to British-led trading companies like
                the Mozambique Company. These corporations established vast plantations and mines where African laborers
                endured extreme hardship, facing disease, starvation, and violent repression. Any resistance was
                brutally crushed.</p>
            <p>20th Century: Systematic Discrimination and Rising Resistance
                In the 20th century, colonial control tightened. While Portugal continued to profit economically, the
                indigenous population remained impoverished. Africans were subjected to high taxes but had no political
                representation.</p>
            <p>Additionally, Portugal established a labor migration system, forcing Mozambican men to work in South
                African mines. This disrupted families and led to social crises.</p>
            <p>By the 1950s and 1960s, growing frustration led to increased resistance. The FRELIMO movement fought for
                independence, launching an armed guerrilla war against Portuguese rule in 1964. Following the Carnation
                Revolution in Portugal, Mozambique finally achieved independence in 1975.
            </p>
            <p>Conclusion:
                Colonial rule in Mozambique was a time of extreme oppression for the indigenous population. Slavery,
                forced labor, racial discrimination, and economic exploitation defined their lives for centuries.
                Portugal viewed Mozambique primarily as a source of raw materials, with little regard for the well-being
                of its people. It was only after independence that Mozambicans could begin to reclaim control over their
                own destiny.</p>
