    <h1>DR Congo</h1>
        China plays a crucial role in the mineral resources sector of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo)
        and
        has a strong economic influence there. The key aspects of China’s involvement in Congo’s mineral wealth are:
        <br>

        <h3>Dominance in the Copper and Cobalt Sector</h3>
        China is the largest buyer of cobalt from DR Congo, which is essential for lithium-ion batteries (used in
        electric
        vehicles and smartphones).
        Chinese companies such as China Molybdenum and Zijin Mining own or control some of the country’s largest mines.
        The Tenke Fungurume mine, one of the world’s most important cobalt and copper mines, is operated by China
        Molybdenum.
        Exmple: The “project of the century,” Sicomines, was praised as a “win-win” initiative. A Chinese consortium
        (China
        Railways & Sinohydro)
        holds 68%, while the Congolese state-owned company Gécamines owns 32%. Sicomines was granted mining rights worth
        $90
        billion for 10.6 million tons of copper and 630,000 tons of cobalt.
        In return, China pledged to finance infrastructure projects worth $9 billion, including roads, railways,
        hospitals,
        and hydropower plants.
        Due to concerns from the IMF about Congo’s rising foreign debt, the investment amount was reduced to $6.5
        billion.
        Large Infrastructure-for-Resources Deals
        <h3>In 2008, China signed a $9 billion deal with DR Congo: </h3>
        Chinese companies built roads, hospitals, and railwaysin exchange for mining rights.
        This agreement, often called the "Sicomines Deal", granted China access to copper and cobalt deposits.
        However, these deals are controversial as they increase Congo’s dependence on China and often lack transparency.
        <h3>Control Over the Supply Chain</h3>
        A large portion of Congolese cobalt is exported to China, where it is refined and used in battery production.
        China dominates not only mining but also the refining and global trade of cobalt.
        <h3>Influence on Local Politics and Economy </h3>
        Chinese investments have deepened Congo’s economic dependence.
        There are allegations of labor rights violations, environmental damage, and illegal mining, especially by
        smaller Chinese companies.
        <h3>Future Outlook </h3>
        The Congolese government has started renegotiating some of its contracts with China to secure better terms.
        Western countries are increasingly seeking alternatives to China’s dominance in the region to reduce reliance on
        Chinese supply chains.
        Overall, through massive investments and strategic deals, China has taken a key role in DR Congo’s mineral
        economy, particularly in the cobalt and copper sectors.
