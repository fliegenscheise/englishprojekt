            <h2>Neocolonialism</h2>
            China plays a crucial role in the mineral resources sector of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR
            Congo)
            and
            has a strong economic influence there. The key aspects of China’s involvement in Congo’s mineral wealth are:
            <br>

            <h3>Dominance in the Copper and Cobalt Sector</h3>
            China is the largest buyer of cobalt from DR Congo, which is essential for lithium-ion batteries (used in
            electric
            vehicles and smartphones).
            Chinese companies such as China Molybdenum and Zijin Mining own or control some of the country’s largest
            mines.
            The Tenke Fungurume mine, one of the world’s most important cobalt and copper mines, is operated by China
            Molybdenum.
            Exmple: The “project of the century,” Sicomines, was praised as a “win-win” initiative. A Chinese consortium
            (China
            Railways & Sinohydro)
            holds 68%, while the Congolese state-owned company Gécamines owns 32%. Sicomines was granted mining rights
            worth
            $90
            billion for 10.6 million tons of copper and 630,000 tons of cobalt.
            In return, China pledged to finance infrastructure projects worth $9 billion, including roads, railways,
            hospitals,
            and hydropower plants.
            Due to concerns from the IMF about Congo’s rising foreign debt, the investment amount was reduced to $6.5
            billion.

            <h3>Large Infrastructure-for-Resources Deals: </h3>
            In 2008, China signed a $9 billion deal with DR Congo. Chinese companies built roads, hospitals, and
            railways in
            exchange for mining rights.
            This agreement, often called the "Sicomines Deal", granted China access to copper and cobalt deposits.
            However, these deals are controversial as they increase Congo’s dependence on China and often lack
            transparency.
            <h3>Control Over the Supply Chain</h3>
            A large portion of Congolese cobalt is exported to China, where it is refined and used in battery
            production.
            China dominates not only mining but also the refining and global trade of cobalt.
            <h3>Influence on Local Politics and Economy </h3>
            Chinese investments have deepened Congo’s economic dependence.
            There are allegations of labor rights violations, environmental damage, and illegal mining, especially by
            smaller Chinese companies.
            <h3>Future Outlook </h3>
            The Congolese government has started renegotiating some of its contracts with China to secure better terms.
            Western countries are increasingly seeking alternatives to China’s dominance in the region to reduce
            reliance on
            Chinese supply chains.
            Overall, through massive investments and strategic deals, China has taken a key role in DR Congo’s mineral
            economy, particularly in the cobalt and copper sectors.

            <h2>Colonial History:</h2>
            King Leopold II of Belgium secured the Congo as his personal private property under the pretext of
            "civilizing"
            Africa. With the help of journalist Henry Morton Stanley, he secretly acquired land through contracts with
            hundreds
            of tribal leaders. In 1884/85, the “Independent State of Congo” was recognized by European powers and the
            United
            States—an unprecedented situation, as colonies typically belonged to states, not individuals.
            <br>
            After gaining official recognition, Leopold II began the ruthless exploitation of the Congo. The rubber
            boom,
            triggered by John Boyd Dunlop’s invention of the pneumatic tire, made natural rubber a highly valuable
            commodity.
            The vast rubber reserves in the tropical rainforests of the Congo Basin became the foundation of Leopold’s
            brutal
            economic system.
            <br>
            The Congolese population was forced into slavery-like labor. Each village was required to supply a set quota
            of
            rubber. Those who failed to meet the quota were punished in horrific ways: men were executed, women were
            taken
            as
            hostages, and children were mutilated. The “Force Publique,” a Belgian-created paramilitary force, enforced
            these
            quotas with extreme brutality. The force was mainly composed of Black soldiers, with only White officers in
            command.
            <br>
            One of the most infamous control mechanisms was the “hand quota” system. Soldiers had to account
            for
            every bullet fired, ensuring that ammunition was not wasted on hunting or rebellion. To prove that each
            bullet
            was
            used effectively, they were required to present the severed right hand of their victim. This led to
            widespread
            mutilation—often of living people. Photographs of men, women, and children with missing hands or feet later
            became
            powerful symbols of Leopold’s reign of terror.
            <br>
            The economic success of Leopold’s Congo was immense. Profits from the rubber trade are estimated by Belgian
            historian Daniël Vangroenweghe to have reached up to €125 million between 1885 and 1908, with some estimates
            going
            as high as €500 million. With this “blood money,” Leopold financed grandiose projects in Belgium, including
            what
            is
            now the Royal Museum for Central Africa near Brussels.
            <br>
            British journalist Edmund Morel discovered that ships traveling to the Congo were loaded almost exclusively
            with
            weapons and chains—clear evidence of systematic slavery and repression. Horrified by the atrocities, Morel
            launched
            the world’s first major human rights campaign in the early 20th century. Through reports and photographs of
            mutilated Congolese, he exposed the scale of the horrors. In 1903, Britain confirmed these allegations in
            the
            Casement Report, increasing international pressure on Leopold II.
            <br>
            Ultimately, Leopold was forced to cede the Congo to the Belgian state in 1908. The colony was renamed
            "Belgian
            Congo" and remained under Belgian control until its independence in 1960. A census in 1911 revealed that
            approximately 10 million Congolese had died under Leopold’s 23-year rule—some estimates even suggest up to
            25
            million deaths. Even under Belgian colonial administration, oppression and economic exploitation continued,
            with
            the
            White elite enjoying privileges while the local population remained marginalized.
